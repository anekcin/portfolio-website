    <h1>Personal Development</h1>

    
    <h2>Summary of Twelve Pillars</h2>
    

    <h3>Chapter 4: Achieve Your Goals</h3>
    <p>This chapter emphasizes the importance of setting and writing down goals. Michael learns that 
        goals are not just about achieving an outcome but about who you become in the process. Mr. Davis 
        teaches that writing goals down brings them into reality and makes the mind actively work toward 
        them. The key takeaway is that goal-setting should be structured with long-term, mid-range, and 
        short-term objectives, each leading to the final vision</p>

    <p><b class="bold">Personal Reflection:</b> I relate to this deeply. As a Computer Science student with aspirations of 
        becoming a software engineer, setting clear goals can provide me with the structure I need. 
        Whether it's mastering a programming language, completing projects, or gaining industry experience, 
        breaking these into smaller, measurable steps will keep me on track. Writing down a list of my career 
        and personal goals can serve as a blueprint for my growth.</p>
    

    <h3>Chapter 5: The Proper Use of Time</h3>
    <p>This chapter highlights how time is a non-renewable resource and that successful people manage it wisely. Many people spend their time on
         what's urgent rather than what's truly important. Mr. Davis teaches that discipline is key to time management—choosing to suffer the pain of 
         discipline rather than the weight of regret. The idea that “either you run the day, or the day runs you” struck a chord with Michael, making him 
         realize he needs to take control of his time.</p>
    
    <p><b class="bold">Personal Reflection:</b> Time management is something I'm always working on, especially balancing coursework, projects, and 
        personal interests like crocheting and reading. This chapter reinforces that I should prioritize tasks that align with my 
        long-term goals rather than getting caught up in distractions. Creating a structured schedule, using time-tracking tools (which aligns 
        with my own project idea), and setting daily priorities can help me stay focused and productive.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 6: Surround Yourself With the Best People</h3>
    <p>Mr. Davis emphasizes that the people we surround ourselves with influence our mindset, attitudes, and ultimately, our success. 
        He encourages Michael to evaluate his friendships and relationships by asking key questions: "Who am I around? What effect do 
        they have on me? What have they got me reading and thinking?" Associating with people who are ambitious, positive, and growth-oriented 
        can have a transformative impact.</p>
    <p><b class="bold">Personal Reflection: </b>This principle resonates deeply with me. Being in university, I interact with various individuals—some ambitious and 
        inspiring, others complacent. I've noticed that when I engage with motivated peers, I feel more driven and excited about my work. This chapter 
        reinforces that I need to be intentional about my circle, seeking mentors, networking with like-minded individuals, and limiting time spent with 
        those who do not contribute positively to my growth.</p>

    <h3>Chapter 7: Be a Life-Long Learner</h3>
    <p>This chapter in this section stresses that education doesn't stop after formal schooling. Mr. Davis teaches that "formal education
         will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune." The truly successful continuously invest in learning, whether through 
         books, mentors, experiences, or personal reflection.</p>
    
    <p><b class="bold">Personal Reflection: </b>This chapter reaffirms something I already believe in—continuous learning is essential. While my 
        university education provides a foundation, my success as a software engineer will depend on how much I continue to educate 
        myself beyond the classroom. Reading tech blogs, taking online courses, and working on real-world projects will ensure I keep growing. 
        I also want to expand my learning beyond just technical skills, incorporating leadership and personal development into my journey.</p><br/><br/>
